        <h2>Chinook Database</h2>
        <p>
            <code>Chinook</code> database is an alternative to the <code>Northwind</code> database, being ideal for
            demos and
            testing ORM
            tools targeting single and multiple database servers.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Model</h3>
        <p>
            The <code>Chinook</code> data model represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums,
            media
            tracks, invoices and customers.</p>
        <h3>Sample Data</h3>
        <p>
            Media related data was created using real data from an <code>iTunes Library</code>. Customer and employee
            information was manually created using fictitious names, addresses that can be located on
            <code>Google Map</code>,
            and other well formatted data (phone, fax, email, etc.). Sales information is auto generated using random
            data for
            a four year period.
        </p>
        <h3>Why the name Chinook?</h3>
        <p>
            The name of this sample database was based on the <code>Northwind</code> database. Chinooks are winds in the
            interior West of North America, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains meet various mountain ranges.
            Chinooks are most prevalent over southern Alberta in Canada. Chinook is a good name choice for a database
            that
            intents to be an alternative to Northwind.</p>
